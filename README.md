Introduction
--

The OLSK Large Laser V3 is the first laser cutter with tool changer, switching the laser source and laser head, using magnetic kinematic coupling. Compatible with multiple laser sources, such as RF CO2 60W and Diode 40W, it automatically changes the focal length and transfers power, data and air. This machine is also the first RF laser cutter, featuring a spring loaded RF laser mount, beam Expander, single point beam adjustment and custom optics mounts. Its innovative chamfered design has a display mounted on the window, integrated light with status indication and dual 16 megapixel camera. The operation is controlled by OLOS, the in-house software, which allows several features such as Gcode generation, job preview, WiFi and ethernet connection, image positioning system and AI image generation.

The Assembly Manual
--

All OLSK machines are open source and have an assembly manual, the BOM and necessary files available in this repository for replication. The assembly manual is an interactive 3D guide though each step and contains a list of parts, tools and instruction remarks, which follows a logic order to provide a smooth assembly.
