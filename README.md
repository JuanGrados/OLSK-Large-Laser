Introduction
--

The OLSK Large Laser V1 is a powerful 75W CO2 laser cutter with large cutting area of 1000 x 700 mm. It can move at a high speed and precision of 0.05mm. With an innovative slim design (1520 x 1120 x 400 mm W x D x H), it is build with a full aluminum and an isolated cutting chamber, separated from the mechanics, electronics and laser optics. It includes a coaxial laser pointer and homing with inductive sensors. As an open source machine, it can be replicable in most Fab Labs and also industrially. The building have been simplified, compared to its predecessor Fabulaser Mini V2, with reduced number of parts and easier assembly process and laser calibration.

Learning by Making
--

The assembly of the OLSK Large Laser provides a unique learning experience. With the help of a workshop with the InMachines team, this laser cutter can be built in a few days, allowing the participants to understand the role of each part and how the mechanics, optics and electronics function from inside out. We also provide a complete kit with all the required parts and machine accessories, so the user can save the time of production and procurement.

The Assembly Workbook
--

All OLSK machines are open source and have the BOM and necessary files available in this repository for replication. The assembly of parts is also documented in a workbook where each step contains a list of parts, tools and instruction remarks, following a logic order to provide a smooth assembly.
